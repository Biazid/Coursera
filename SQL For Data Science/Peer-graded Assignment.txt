Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just 
like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as 
the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and 
comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research 
question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be 
graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer 
your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text 
Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some 
other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.

In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 
ii. Business table = 10000 
iii. Category table = 10000 
iv. Checkin table = 10000 
v. elite_years table = 10000 
vi. friend table = 10000 
vii. hours table = 10000 
viii. photo table = 10000 
ix. review table = 10000 
x. tip table = 10000 
xi. user table = 10000 
	
select count(*) as 
total_records
from attribute;

2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please 
specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 
ii. Hours = 1562 
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115  
v. Review = id:10000, business_id: 8090, user_id: 9581
vi. Checkin = 493 
vii. Photo = id: 10000, business_id: 6493
viii. Tip =  user_id: 537, business_id: 3979
ix. User = 10000 
x. Friend = 11 
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	

SELECT COUNT (distinct id ) from business; 
SELECT COUNT (distinct business_id ) from hours 
SELECT COUNT (distinct business_id ) from Category 
SELECT COUNT (distinct business_id ) from Attribute 
SELECT COUNT (distinct id), count(distinct business_id), COUNT(distinct user_id) from review 
SELECT COUNT (distinct business_id ) from Checkin 
SELECT COUNT (distinct id ), count(distinct business_id ) from photo 
SELECT COUNT (distinct business_id ),count ( distinct user_id) from tip 
SELECT COUNT (distinct id ) from User 
SELECT COUNT (distinct user_id ) from Friend 
SELECT COUNT (distinct user_id ) from Elite_years	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the 
businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
+--------------------------------+----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+-----------+---------+
| name                           | category | city      | zipcode | hours               | rating    | reviews |
+--------------------------------+----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+-----------+---------+
| Desert Medical Equipment       | Shopping | Las Vegas | 89118   | Monday|8:00-17:00   | 4-5 stars |       4 |
| Red Rock Canyon Visitor Center | Shopping | Las Vegas | 89161   | Saturday|8:00-16:30 | 4-5 stars |      32 |
| Walgreens                      | Shopping | Las Vegas | 89121   | Saturday|8:00-22:00 | 2-3 stars |       6 |
+--------------------------------+----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+-----------+---------+	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Ans: Yes ,they do have different distribution hours. 
	 The 4-5 star group seems to have shorter hours then the 2-3 star group.
	 (Please note the query returned only three businesses so not a great sample size)

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Ans: Yes and no, one of the 4-5 star group has a lot more reviews but then the other
	 4-5 star group has close to the same number of reviews as the 2-3 star group.         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
Ans: No, every business is in a different zip-code.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT B.name ,
        C.category,
		B.city, 
		B.postal_code as zipcode,
		H.hours, 
		    CASE
			   WHEN stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
			   WHEN stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
		       END AS rating,
		B.review_count as reviews
    From business B
		Inner join hours H  on B.id = H.business_id
		Inner join category C on C.business_id = B.id
		Where city = 'Las Vegas' and category = 'Shopping' and rating in ('2-3 stars','4-5 stars')
		Group By name
		Order By stars desc
+--------------------------------+----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+-----------+---------+
| name                           | category | city      | zipcode | hours               | rating    | reviews |
+--------------------------------+----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+-----------+---------+
| Desert Medical Equipment       | Shopping | Las Vegas | 89118   | Monday|8:00-17:00   | 4-5 stars |       4 |
| Red Rock Canyon Visitor Center | Shopping | Las Vegas | 89161   | Saturday|8:00-16:30 | 4-5 stars |      32 |
| Walgreens                      | Shopping | Las Vegas | 89121   | Saturday|8:00-22:00 | 2-3 stars |       6 |
+--------------------------------+----------+-----------+---------+---------------------+-----------+---------+

		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still 
open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
Ans: The average review count is around 8 points more for business that are open than the business that are closed.
        Open  : AVG(review_count) = 31.757
		Closed: AVG(review_count) = 23.198

ii. Difference 2:
Ans: The average star rating is higher for businesses that are open than businesses that are closed.
	
			Open  : AVG(stars) = 3.679
			Closed: AVG(stars) = 3.520
	
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT  count(distinct id), 
		count(distinct city),
		avg(stars), 
        avg(review_count),
		is_open
	From business
	Group By is_open
+--------------------+----------------------+---------------+-------------------+---------+
| count(distinct id) | count(distinct city) |    avg(stars) | avg(review_count) | is_open |
+--------------------+----------------------+---------------+-------------------+---------+
|               1520 |                  144 | 3.52039473684 |     23.1980263158 |       0 |

+--------------------+----------------------+---------------+-------------------+---------+

	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to 
prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or 
anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are 
just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, 
in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Ans: Here I chose to study the preference among different types of food on yelp.         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

Ans: I will pick several types of food including “Chinese”,”Mexican”,”Korean”,”French”,”Italian”,”Japanese” and “Indian”. 
	 Then I will analyze their star ratings and number of reviews so that I can get some insights on which type of food is popular on yelp.

iii. Output of your finished dataset:
